# Smartwatch
This repository contains the source code for a smartwatch prototype using ESP32 microcontroller which collects data from SpO2 &amp; heartrate sensor ,uses an accelerometer sensor to count steps and an NTC thermistor to get the temperature. It also sends the data to the firebase in realtime. 
This project was created for Titan's future wear hackathon which was held in Bangalore in the titan's campus. There are many versions of this code which are stored locally but this is the final code that we went with as it's the most efficient one. 
Now, you can use this code to build your own smartwatch too.
